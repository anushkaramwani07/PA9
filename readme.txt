Discription:
This is a game where the player must move through a invisable maze. 
There are three difficulties (easy, medium, hard) that you must select with your number keys on the key board. 
In easy, you need to get to the end without worrying about enemy.
Your goal is to reach the end of the maze (clearly marked as end). 
Once you have found the "walls" of the maze they then appear so you know not to go that way again.
You move the player by pressing the arrow keys.
There is a slight delay for key presses so don't spam your key board.
In medium, for every 5 move that player makes, enemy gets closer to the end. 
So pleayer needs to get to the end before enemy to win the game. 
In the Hard level there is an enemy that will chace the player.
Don't get caught 3 times or else it's game over.
In hard level, the enemy keeps getting closer to the player and if the enemy meet the player 3 times, then the game is over.
