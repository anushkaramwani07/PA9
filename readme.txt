Discription:
This is a game where the player must move through a invisable maze. There are three difficulties (easy, medium, hard) that you
must select with your number keys on the key board. Your goal is to reach the end of the maze (clearly marked as end). Once you have
found the "walls" of the maze they then appear so you know not to go that way again.
