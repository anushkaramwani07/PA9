Discription:
This is a game where the player must move through a invisable maze. 
There are three difficulties (easy, medium, hard) that you must select with your number keys on the key board. 
Your goal is to reach the end of the maze (clearly marked as end). 
Once you have found the "walls" of the maze they then appear so you know not to go that way again.
You move the player by pressing the arrow keys.
There is a slight delay for key presses so don't spam your key board.
In the Hard level there is an enemy that will chace the player.
Don't get caught 3 times or else it's game over.
